He wants to be a good player when the season starts.  James has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.  He has to make up for it by playing baseball for 5 hours every day for a week.  James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.  So James and Tommy practice every day.  They throw the ball around.  They practice batting and they practice fielding.  Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.  He says \\\"I do not believe it, James, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!\\\"  Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.  Then James has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He can't keep playing with a broken glove!  So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.  James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.  This is enough money for James to buy a new glove!  So James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some more.  By the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team. What is James' friend's name?\\nA. Harry\\nB. Tommy\\nC. Arnold\\nD.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\\\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \\\"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?\\nA. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.\\nB. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.\\nC. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.\\nD. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.\\n\\nSelect the most appropriate answer or options to fill in the blank (if any): \",\n",

The fan, who was employed as a bricklayer, realized that he could not leave work to purchase the tickets. Consequently, the fan telephoned his next-door neighbor and asked him if he would be interested in going to the stadium to purchase the baseball tickets. The neighbor told the fan that he would be happy to purchase the tickets for him and that he (the neighbor) also wanted to buy tickets for himself.

The neighbor agreed, and the following morning the two men met in front of the fan's home. The fan gave the neighbor the keys to his car and also money with which to buy his baseball tickets. Thereafter, the neighbor drove the fan's car to the stadium where he purchased the tickets for the fan and (using his own money) also bought a set of tickets for himself.

When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog.\\\"  Jamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first.   \\\"This dog is pretty big, Jamey,\\\" his father said. \\\"He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have.\\\"    Jamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it.  \\\"This dog is very noisy Jamey. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?\\\"  Jamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.  \\\"Do you like the brown dog?\\\" asked Jamey's dad.  \\\"Yes!\\\" said Jamey. \\\"Can we get him?\\\"  \\\"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?\\\" asked Jamey's mom.  \\\"I promise,\\\" said Jamey.  \\\"In that case, I guess we have a dog!\\\"  This made Jamey very happy.

There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \\u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.

I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\\\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \\\"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?\\nA. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.\\nB. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant.\\nC. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.\\nD. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.\\n\\nSelect the most appropriate answer or options to fill in the blank (if any): \",\n",
