    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook, where we will explore how you can use the benchmarking features in Moonshot to evaluate your LLMs and LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarking within Moonshot\n",
    "To gauge the performance of AI models, we'll employ Moonshot's benchmarking capabilities. By conducting a series of tests, we'll assess the model's prowess across various tasks, shedding light on its efficiency and precision. These insights are invaluable in understanding and maximizing the model's potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Establishing a Connection with AI Models\n",
    "Our first step is to create connector endpoints to the LLMs that you want to evaluate. We'll walk you through setting up an endpoint, which serves as a conduit between Moonshot and the AI model residing on the provider's servers. This process ensures a robust and uninterrupted flow of interaction with the AI model during testing."
